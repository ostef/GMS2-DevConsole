# GMS2-DevConsole

Developper console for Game Maker Studio 2.3.

**DISCLAIMER:**
I have not worked on this project for a long time and it is nowhere near completion. I don't know when I will get the time to get back at it, if ever.

**Features (off the top of my head):**
* Cursor movement using keyboard,
* Selection,
* Simple auto complete,
* Copy and pase,
* Word skipping
